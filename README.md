Searchonymous2
==============
This is a fork of the original [Searchonymous by Merten Peetz](https://github.com/MorbZ/Searchonymous) that ports the Chrome version to a Firefox WebExtension.

Searchonymous2 helps to prevent your Google searches from tracking by Google or intelligence. When installed no tracking cookies are sent to Google while searching. You will stay logged in on other Google services such as Youtube or Gmail. It also removes privacy and cookie hints from the Google search page since those would pop up on every page visit otherwise.
